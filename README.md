# BBCNews Tweets Analysis
This project involved scraping data from the BBC News World Twitter profile and conducting an analysis that encompassed data cleaning, predicting tweet categories using logistic regression, and analysing the tweets based on word counts and the countries they referred to.

Once the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, a logistic regression model was employed to predict the category of each tweet. This model allowed for the categorisation of tweets into specific topics or themes, providing valuable insights into the content being shared by the BBC News World Twitter profile.

In addition to predicting tweet categories, the project also delved into analysing the tweets in terms of word counts. This analysis shed light on the most frequently used words or phrases in the tweets, enabling a deeper understanding of the key topics and subjects covered by the BBC News World profile.

Moreover, the project explored the geographical aspect of the tweets by determining the countries of the world that were referenced in each tweet. This analysis helped identify the regions or nations that were frequently discussed or featured in the BBC News World Twitter feed.
